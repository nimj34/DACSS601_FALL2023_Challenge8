## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

1.  What was the last movie you saw in the theater?

```{r}
#Five Nights at Freddys
```

2.  What did you eat for today\'s lunch?

```{r}
#I haven't had lunch yet.
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
